## Why is **ying**?

Well, most Chinese netizens know the meaning.

In the Chinese Internet, it means **Âò§**, which is like a lovely girl crying.

## Something about @ying-web

From my perspective, `@ying-web` is my core web projects repository.

In the past, because of a poor management strategy, I created many projects under my github, gitlab and gitee accounts, and it was really messy.

Now, I want to migrate and maintain all the significant projects under `@ying-web`.

Additionally, I attempt to remove all the Chinese descriptions, comments and api information in the projects, and replace them with English.

In my opinion, the projects under `@ying-web` should be the most valuable ones in my github.

What will I go on to do?

First, make it tidy and full of English.

Next, create some useful projects under `@ying-web`.

Then, use the correct URL for each project.

Finally, make it run and deploy automatically.

## What do I want to achieve?

The below are the projects that I want to achieve:

### project structure

As a modern project, it should have a good project structure.

So, I should add these functions to the project:

#### Root

-   [ ] `husky` + `lint-staged` + `commitlint`
-   [ ] `Webhook` (Maybe github actions or vercel or even others) + `Docker`

#### Detailed projects

-   [ ] `changeset`
-   [ ] Detailed documents

### @ying-web/api-service

This is a core api service for `@ying-web`.

Although it's simple, I attempt to make it cover a whole `@ying-web` system as an api service.

I imagine it will be complete and useful in the future.

### @ying-web/admin

This is a admin system for `@ying-web`.

Why will I create it?

Because I've created a RABC system of admin system in `@ying-web/api-service`.

If only I visualize it, it will be valuable.

So, I decide to create it and run it on [https://admin.krissarea.com](https://admin.krissarea.com).

### @ying-web/events

First of all, I want to say, this project is a small tool about Christian and I have finished it by `Vue3`.

However, I found in the overseas market, `React` is more popular than `Vue`, so I decide to rewrite it by `React` in the future.

The interesting thing is that, I attempted to rewrite it by `Next.js`, but I found it's not a good choice for a small tool that only runs on the client side.

So, I decide to rewrite it by pure `React` in the future.

Now, it's running on [https://events.krissarea.com](https://events.krissarea.com)

And, I am considering to change its name to `@ying-web/christian`.

But, Now, I should finish the rewrite of `@ying-web/events` by `React` first.

### @ying-web/home

First of all, I would make it into [https://www.krissarea.com](https://www.krissarea.com).

It's my entry domain of mine.

As the proposal, I want to make it more beautiful and useful.

However, I have no idea about how to do it yet.

But the certain thing is, I will create a new project under `@ying-web` to host it.

### @ying-web/tools

This is a tool library for `@ying-web`.

It's a collection of some useful tools that I have created.

Yes, maybe you can seek some replacements on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

But, I still attempt to create some simple and useful tools for `@ying-web`.

## What don't I want to migrate?

### [https://diary.krissarea.com](https://diary.krissarea.com)

As a diary collection that just records my life, I think [vercel](https://vercel.com) is good enough for it.

So, I don't want to migrate it to `@ying-web`.

### [https://fe.krissarea.com](https://fe.krissarea.com)

Yes, I want to maintain a blog about front-end knowledges **(maybe the vital part of it is the interview knowledges)**.

As I see it, [vercel](https://vercel.com) is the best choice for it.

Here are some reasons:

-   It's a static website.
-   It doesn't involve any valuable code.

So, I don't want to create it under `@ying-web`.

### [https://blog.krissarea.com](https://blog.krissarea.com)

This is the first chinese FE technical blog of mine and it exists in gitee.

Although it's a manually deployed one, I still don't want to migrate it to `@ying-web`.

Maybe I will automate it in the future or migrate it to vercel.

But, migrate it to `@ying-web` is not a good choice.

## In the future

Maybe, I will create some interesting projects in the future.

It's just depends on my brainstorm or impulse.

I really believe that creativity and enthusiasm will illuminate my life.

Who knows?
