PS: Currently on the lookout for exciting opportunities! If you've got something interesting, let's chat! 🤝

## Why "ying"? 🤔

If you're familiar with Chinese internet culture, you probably know this one! 😉

It's from the Chinese word "**嘤**" - imagine a cute girl's playful cry. Super kawaii, right? 🎀

## About @ying-web 📚

Think of `@ying-web` as my coding treasure chest! 💎

After years of spreading my projects across GitHub, GitLab, and Gitee (yeah, it got a bit messy 😅), I decided it was time for a grand reunion under the `@ying-web` umbrella.

My mission? 🎯

1. Make everything neat and tidy
2. Switch to all-English documentation
3. Move everything to GitHub
4. Set up proper URLs for each project
5. Get everything running and deploying automatically

## The Master Plan 🗺️

Here's what's cooking:

### Project Structure 🏗️

Every modern project needs a solid foundation:

#### Root Level 🌳

-   ✅ `husky` + `lint-staged` + `commitlint`
-   🚧 `Webhook` (GitHub Actions/Vercel/etc.) + `Docker`

#### Project Level 🌱

-   ✅ `changeset`
-   🚧 Detailed documentation

### @ying-web/api-service 🔌

The backbone of our ecosystem! While it's starting simple, it's destined to power the entire `@ying-web` system. Watch this space! 🚀

### @ying-web/admin 🎛️

A sleek admin system built on our RBAC foundation in `@ying-web/api-service`.

Check it out at [https://admin.krissarea.com](https://admin.krissarea.com)! ✨

### @ying-web/events ⛪

A special project close to my heart - a Christian tool originally built in Vue3. But hey, React is the talk of the town overseas, so we're giving it a React makeover! 🔄

Check it out at [https://events.krissarea.com](https://events.krissarea.com)

(Psst... might rename it to `@ying-web/christian` later, but first things first!)

### @ying-web/diary 📔

My personal diary project - a place to record my thoughts and experiences. It's not just a blog, it's a personal journal! 📖

Check it out at [https://diary.krissarea.com](https://diary.krissarea.com)

### @ying-web/fe-docs 📚

My documentation site - a place to share my knowledge and experiences with the Front-end developer field! 📚

Check it out at [https://fe.krissarea.com](https://fe.krissarea.com)! ✨

### @ying-web/tools 🛠️

My personal collection of handy utilities. Sure, npm has alternatives, but sometimes you just want to build your own tools, right? 😊

### [wip] @ying-web/home 🏠

My main website (maybe just an entry of my projects) at [https://www.krissarea.com](https://www.krissarea.com).

Still brainstorming how to make it extra special! 🎨

## The Future is Bright! 🌈

Who knows what cool projects might pop into my head next? I'm always excited to try new things and let creativity guide the way!

Stay tuned for more awesome stuff! ✨

Remember: The best code is written with passion and a sprinkle of fun! 🎮
